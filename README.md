# ForkWBomb
Fork Bomb for Windows, a simple program that executes a denial of service (DoS) to crash this operating system.
It is one of the simplest programs, a single .bat file that is downloaded and executed on the victim's computer. The program calls a function (which is itself) and loops, causing Windows to crash.
